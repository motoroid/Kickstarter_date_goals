# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.
### Purpose
She has requested to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenged I had was the "Outcomes Based on Goal"  Did not match the one on the assignment. I double checked mine and it seems to matcht he excel sheet. for instance the one published did not show any canceled ones, but that isn't accurate as there are 2 that are at the $15,000 range.  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.  The best time to successfully launch a theater play is from April to July with a peak around the May time line.  
2.  There doesbn't seem to be a huge difference in failures or cancelation based on date.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
This section is a little less obvious.  Mine didn't match the assignment as discussed in the next section.  Overall the ration of successful to failure has the largest difference less than $5,000 and between $35,000-$45,000.   
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
