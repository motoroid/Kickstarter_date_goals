# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.
### Purpose
She has requested to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I spent a lot of time playing with pivot tables to understand them more.  It was interesting how I had to close things in the Years column to make it look good.  Such as the quarters.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This task was pretty time intensive in making sure the formulas matched.  I think there are some tricks that would make it easier such as using $E$1 which helps lock the cells so it's easier to copy and paste the formulas.  Once I figured that out it made the process quicker.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenged I had was the "Outcomes Based on Goal"  did not match the one on the assignment. I double checked mine and it seems to match the excel sheet. It took me a little while to find the problem whish was I wasn't filtering by subcategory "plays."  After I took care of that it worked well.  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1.  The best time to successfully launch a theater play is from April to July with a peak around the May time line.  
  2.  There doesbn't seem to be a huge difference in failures or cancelation based on date.  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1. This graph was interesting in that it crossed over at the 15-19K , 35-40 K and 45-49 K.  I wonder if that means there really isn't a correlation except that after 45 K there were more likely to fail than succeed.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  1.  This data set was based on goal and did not include pledged.  Although this is good information it probably would be better using pledged amount.
  2.  This is also limited to one country so it would be good to see if the trend is similar elsewhere.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  1.  Outcomes based on pledged
  2.  Outcomes based on country
  3.  Pledged based on goals
